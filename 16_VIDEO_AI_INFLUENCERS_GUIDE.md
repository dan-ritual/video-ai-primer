## Why This Matters

```
INFORMATION ALPHA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The AI video space moves at breakneck speed.
New models drop weekly. Workflows evolve daily.

Your competitive advantage = Information velocity

Following the right people = 2-4 week head start
Over practitioners who rely on official announcements

THE SIGNAL CHAIN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Researcher → Twitter Power User → YouTube Creator → Blog → Mainstream

By the time it hits mainstream coverage, the alpha is gone.
Position yourself at the front of this chain.
```

SPECIALTY: AI Character Swap Workflows

PUBLISHED GUIDES:
├── "How-to Guide for Viral AI Character Swaps"
├── Kling AI move/replace model comparison
├── Wan 2.2 Animate workflows
└── Start frame preparation techniques

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM HER RESEARCH:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Kling AI = Current leader for character swaps
   - Handles up to 30 second reference videos
   - Two modes: "Move" (new scene) vs "Replace" (same scene)

2. Reference Video Requirements:
   - Single character, clear shot
   - Entire upper body or full body visible
   - No complex backgrounds initially

3. Start Frame Quality:
   - "Clean" first frames critical
   - Proportions must match reference exactly
   - No extra people in frame

FUTURE OUTLOOK (Her Prediction):
"Today: people turning themselves into influencers
Tomorrow: this transforms ads, TV, and movies"

## PsyopAnime Workflow Analysis

### Deep Dive: The PsyopAnime Method

Based on community analysis and public statements, here's what we know about PsyopAnime's production approach:

```
PHILOSOPHY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Core Principle: "It isn't the tool, it's the craft"

The breakthrough isn't any single model—it's:
1. Multi-tool orchestration
2. Traditional post-production skills
3. SFX/editing expertise layered on top
4. Understanding each tool's strengths

CONFIRMED TOOL STACK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Image Generation:
├── Midjourney (primary for style/character design)
└── Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image)

Video Generation:
├── VEO 3 (Google's latest)
└── Kling AI (motion, character work)

Post-Production:
├── Traditional SFX workflows
├── Professional editing software
└── Photoshop skills (mentioned in hiring post)

PRODUCTION APPROACH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Start with strong image generation
   - Midjourney for style-locked character frames
   - Niji mode for anime-specific aesthetics
   - Multiple iterations to nail the look

2. Select best images as start frames
   - Quality of input = quality of output
   - Composition matters for video motion

3. Generate video with appropriate tool
   - Kling for character motion
   - VEO 3 for complex scenes
   - Match tool to shot requirements

4. Heavy post-production
   - This is the secret sauce
   - SFX, color grading, compositing
   - Traditional skills amplify AI output

5. Edit for narrative
   - Pacing, rhythm, storytelling
   - Not just concatenating AI clips
   - Cinematic sensibility

STATED AMBITION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"I want to start an AI anime studio"

Requirements (per hiring post):
- Midjourney subscriptions
- Photoshop skills
- "Badasses" (implying creative excellence)

Project framing:
- "Non-commercial fan film"
- "Technical demonstration"
- "Push these models to their limits"
- "Explore what's possible with new tools"
```

### Lessons for Your Workflow

```
TAKEAWAY 1: Tool Orchestration > Tool Mastery
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Don't perfect one tool. Learn to combine:
- Image model → Video model → Post-production
- Each stage amplifies the last

TAKEAWAY 2: Post-Production is Not Optional
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Raw AI output is a starting point, not an end.
Professional results require:
- SFX work
- Color grading
- Compositing
- Sound design (not just AI audio)

TAKEAWAY 3: Traditional Skills Transfer
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Photoshop skills mentioned specifically.
Traditional creative foundations:
- Composition
- Color theory
- Timing/pacing
- Storytelling
These don't become obsolete—they become more valuable.

TAKEAWAY 4: Team > Solo (At Scale)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Stated desire to build a studio.
Even with AI, complex projects need:
- Multiple skill sets
- Division of labor
- Quality control across stages
```
